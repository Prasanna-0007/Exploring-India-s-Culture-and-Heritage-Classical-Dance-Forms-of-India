<h3> History of Bhangra
</h3>
<p>Bhangra is a lively and energetic folk dance that originated in the Punjab region of India and Pakistan. It began as a celebratory dance performed by farmers during the harvest festival of Vaisakhi, which marks the beginning of the Punjabi New Year and the harvesting of wheat. Traditionally performed by men in the fields, Bhangra was a way to express joy and gratitude for a good harvest. Over time, different villages developed their own variations of the dance, and it evolved into a more structured form. In the mid-20th century, Bhangra was adapted for stage performances and became popular in cultural festivals and competitions. With the rise of the Punjabi diaspora, especially in the UK and Canada, Bhangra gained global popularity and began fusing with Western music styles like hip-hop and pop, creating a modern, dynamic version of the traditional dance. Today, Bhangra remains a symbol of Punjabi pride, energy, and cultural identity around the world.</p>
