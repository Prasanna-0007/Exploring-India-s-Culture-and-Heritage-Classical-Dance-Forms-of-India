    <h1>Kuchipudi</h1>
    <p>Kuchipudi is one of the eight major classical dance forms of India. Originating from a village named Kuchipudi in the Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, this dance style beautifully blends graceful movements, expressive acting (abhinaya), and rhythmic footwork.

        Historically, Kuchipudi was performed by male Brahmin priests, known as Bhagavatulu, as part of religious storytelling dramas dedicated to Lord Krishna. Over time, it evolved into a solo dance form performed by both men and women on the modern stage.

<p>Kuchipudi originated in the village of Kuchipudi in Andhra Pradesh. Traditionally performed by male Brahmins as dance-dramas (Bhagavata Melas), it is now performed by both men and women worldwide.</p>
<h3>Main Components of Kuchipudi</h3>
<p>1.Nritta (Pure dance): Rhythm and footwork without expression.<br>

    2.Nritya (Expressive dance): Combines rhythm with expression and storytelling.<br>
    
    3.Natya (Drama): The theatrical aspect — acting with mudras, expressions, and movements.</p>
<h3>Basic Steps (Adavus)</h3>
<p>Like Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi also has Adavus (basic steps), but they are lighter and more fluid. Some core types include:</p>
<h3>1. Tatta Adavu</h3>
<p>Stamping the foot on the ground.<br>

    Used to establish rhythm and posture</p>
    <h3>4. Tirmanam Adavu</h3>
    <p>Used for transition in dance segments.<br>

        Involves intricate footwork.</p>
        <h3>Mudras (Hand Gestures)</h3>
        <p>Kuchipudi uses Hasta Mudras as codified in the Natya Shastra. These are used to convey emotion, action, objects, and more.
            Asamyuta Hastas (Single-hand)<br>

            Samyuta Hastas (Double-hand)
        </p>
        <h3 >Signature Kuchipudi Elements</h3>
        <p>Tarangam: The dancer performs on a brass plate while balancing a pot on the head. A display of extreme control and grace.

            Abhinaya: Emphasis on facial expressions and storytelling, especially from mythology (Krishna, Rama, etc.).
            
            Costumes: Bright silk sarees with stitched pleats that fan out during movement. Jewelry, flowers, and ankle bells complete the look.
            
            Music: Based on Carnatic tradition – uses mridangam, flute, veena, violin.</p>
            <h3>Famous Kuchipudi Items</h3>
